          <p>Five-year-old Killian Owen loved sports, especially baseball, basketball and swimming. He enjoyed playing (and competing!) with his brothers. On December 10, 1999, Killian was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia. Despite the best efforts of those caring for Killian and his own determination the disease took his life on July 27, 2003. He was nine years old.</p>
          <p>We work in Killian's memory for children who need a cure. Join us in this fight for an end to childhood cancer.</p>
